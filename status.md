Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far i've created 2 weapons, a Baseball Bat and a Metal Baseball Bat. Three tools, a Stone Pickaxe, a Stone Axe, and a Stone Pickaxe Axe. Finally 1 new material, "Condensed Gel" which I made drop from KingSlime. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Create more items, armor, tools. I also need to make items from the Condensed Gel. I am planning on making my own projectile for a Condensed Gel Sword.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I havent encountered any major problems so far but I might run into problems making the custom projcttile. I did find it a little difficult to figure out how to add Condensed Gel to the KingSlime loot bag.
