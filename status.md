#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far i've created 2 weapons, a baseball bat and a metal baseball bat. Three tools, a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, and a stone pickaxe axe. Finally 1 new matterial condensed gel which I made drop from KingSlime. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Create more items, armor, tools. I also need to make items from the condensed gel. I am planning on making my own projectile for a condensed gel sword.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I havent encountered any major problems so far but I might run into problems making the custom projcttile. I did find it a little difficult to figure out how to add condensed gel to the KingSlime loot bag.
